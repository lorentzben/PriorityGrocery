# Priority Grocery
## Ensminger Lorentz

### Description
> We plan to make an app that provides an interactive grocery list for users. When putting in items in the grocery list, users will be able to decide which items are high priority and which are lower priority based on a number scale. When users have collected an item on the list, they can press the item and it will disappear from the prioritized queue that acts as the list. The app will also have some sort of trip cost feature. This will most likely be a map where the item is the key and the user enters in the value for the key once they collect the item at the store. A running total will be displayed during the trip and once the trip is finished the user can have a virtual receipt appear.

### Project Milestones
+ Build prioritized Queue that allows us to enter in a series of items to pick up at the grocery store and allow you to pick items that are a priority.
+ Build a map that allows us to have keys that are grocery items that have been picked up and allows the user to enter in the cost of the item so that there can be a running total for their shopping trip. At the end of the trip a virtual receipt would be available based on the entries in this map.
+ Ensure that the command line interface application works for all cases and is solid enough to move forward on the android application. Include a while loop to address whether the user wants to add items or if the are ready to shop.
+ Build an android application based off of a template that is available to us. This will be relatively simple interface, containing only a few buttons, a list of items, and a trip total.
